# NeuralNetwork-for-Bioprinting
Data preprocessing and implemented regression and classification neural network models.
This project implement hyperparameterization and experimentation with different models. Using several activation function, droput, momentum, kfold cross validation and more.

This implements the model done in Shuyu Tian et al. “Machine assisted experimentation of extrusion-based bioprinting systems”. In: Micromachines 12.7 (2021), p. 780. Data was pulled from https://osf.io/qd5k8
